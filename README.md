# nrf_button_caf

on the nRF52840 and 5340DK.

Uses [CAF Click Detector](!https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/libraries/caf/click_detector.html) to determine button clicks and have different actions.

Based on this sample: https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/2.4.1/nrf/samples/caf/README.html

Not completely cleaned up, but gets you close.

# I also prefer using timers like I did [**here**](https://github.com/droidecahedron/nrf_io_practice/tree/main) for similar behavior. Use this repo at your own discretion.

# usage

- Press button 2 once to alternate the direction of the led scroll.
- Press button 2 twice to alternate the speed of the led scroll.
